![Suzie with yet another bubble tea](/img/16c98220-bc47-499a-8c70-b72d6efdae8b.jpeg)

## Taro milk tea
A cake like milk tea that has a distinct light purple colour. The purple is... Honey pearls 

## Taiwanese style milk tea
A black tea base with milk and sweetener

## Fresh coconut milk drink 
This technically doesn't count as a tea of any sort but it was delicious so it certainly makes the cut! Sweet coconut milk, ice topped with coconut cream, tapioca pearls
