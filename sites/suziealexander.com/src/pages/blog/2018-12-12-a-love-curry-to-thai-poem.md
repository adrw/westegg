Allow me to express my love.

```
Thai curry oh Thai curry 
You are different every place we go
You are made simmering really slow
Everyone sees you in different flavour notes
But rice is the base your saucy sauce coats

Thai curry Thai curry
You keep my tummy warm 
With your multidimensional flavour form

Love, 
Suzie
