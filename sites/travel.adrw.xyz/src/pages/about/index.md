### 4 Weeks

We'll be away Dec 9 - Jan 4.

### 4 Countries

We'll be exploring Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.

### 2 Backpacks

Our trip won't be through hostels too much thanks to Airbnb but we still will only be traveling with 1 backpack each. We'll stay nimble and light!

### See you soon with some new stories!
