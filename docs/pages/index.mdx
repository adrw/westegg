# Welcome to Westegg Gatsby Themes!

The town for thoughtful Gatsby Themes and website starters that will let your project always stay up to date.

Gatsby Themes abstract away theming and code away from your content.

1. Find a theme you like in Westegg
2. Copy the starter code into a repo for your new website
3. Periodically update the versions in `package.json` (or use Renovate bot)
4. Always have the newest code without ever writing a line of Javascript!
